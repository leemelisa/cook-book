### A cookbook to view different types of recipes and to create a grocery shopping list. 
### By Melisa Lee
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Getting Started
This is a full-stack application using MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, Node) the frontend utilizes React and the backend uses the Express framework. 

If you haven't done so already go ahead and clone the repo by entering the following:<br/>
`git clone https://github.com/leemelisa/one-cookbook.git`

Once thats done `cd` into the `one-cookbook` directory. You will see the following file structure by entering `ls` in the command line.
```
/one-cookbook
    /server
    /client
    README.md
```

The `/server` contains all the code for the Express backend.<br/>
The `/client` contains all the code for the React frontend.

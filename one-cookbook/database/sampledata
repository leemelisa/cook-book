      step: 'Cut your potatoes before boiling.  I know, so many of us grew up boiling whole potatoes.  But the problem is that large, whole potatoes cook unevenly.  So instead, cut your potatoes into evenly sized smaller pieces for quick and even boiling.'
    },
    {
      step: 'Don’t overboil.  Or maybe the tip should be, don’t multitask too much near the end of the potatoes’ cooking time.  ;)  You want to keep a close eye on them.  And as soon as a dinner knife can be inserted easily into a potato with minimal resistance, they’re ready to go.'
    },
    {
      step: 'Pan “dry” after cooking.  Then, one more step!  Immediately after the potatoes have been drained, return them to the hot stockpot, and place it back on the hot burner over low heat.  Hold the stockpot handles with oven mitts, and gently shake the pan for about 1 minute to release some of the steam and moisture from the potatoes.  Then remove the pan from the heat and set it aside, and your potatoes will be ready to mash'
    },
    {
      step: 'Don’t overmix!  In general, you want to stir the liquids into your mashed potatoes until they are just combined.  Otherwise if you overmix, they can crossover into gummy territory, which is no good.'
    },
    {
      step: 'Season with salt along the way.  We will use fine sea salt to season the potatoes both (1) in the water while they are boiling and (2) afterwards, when adding in the butter, milk and cream cheese.  As always when seasoning a recipe, taste-taste-taste along the way while you are preparing the recipe, and add more salt as needed.'

  notes: 'Possible variations: Garlic mashed potatoes: To make your mashed potatoes extra garlicky, feel free to double or triple the amount of garlic added to this recipe.  Or, feel free to roast a head of garlic while the potatoes are boiling and add the roasted cloves to the mash for extra-rich flavor.'
